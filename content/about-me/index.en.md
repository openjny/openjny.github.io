I am Junya Yamaguchi (usually going by @openjny), a Japanese guy working at Microsoft as Cloud Solution Architect. While my professional speciality is Azure (AI, Apps Modernization, Networking, etc), I pretty much enjoy diverse genres such as Machine Learning, PenTesting, and so on. I currently live in Tokyo🗼, playing tourist from time to time.
